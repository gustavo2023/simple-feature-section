## Overview

### What I learned

In this project, I deepened my understanding of CSS Grid. Here are some key takeaways:

- **Grid Layout**: I learned how to create a responsive grid layout using the `grid-template-columns` property to define the number and size of columns.
- **Media Queries**: I applied media queries to adjust the grid layout for different screen sizes, ensuring a responsive design.
- **Grid Item Placement**: I used properties like `grid-column` to control the placement and spanning of grid items across multiple columns and rows.
- **Alignment**: I learned how to center grid items using properties like `justify-self` and `align-self`.

Overall, CSS Grid provided a powerful and flexible way to create a responsive and visually appealing layout for the feature section.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
